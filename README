Build environment for starting a C project.

It is expected that you have astyle and ctags installed.

Run tools/big-brother.sh to initialize your githooks & git aliases.  big-brother.sh is attached to your post-merge githook so that after each git pull, it will get rerun, allowing you to update githooks and tools.  Source files go in src, include files go in inc.  Enjoy.
